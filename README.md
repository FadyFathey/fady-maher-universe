## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0.0 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/FadyFathey/fady-maher-universe.git](https://github.com/FadyFathey/fady-maher-universe.git)
cd fady-maher-universe
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

This project requires a connection to a Supabase project.

1.  Sign up for a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
2.  Create a new project.
3.  Go to **Project Settings > API**.
4.  Find your **Project URL** and **`anon` (public) key**.
5.  Update the connection details in the Supabase client file:

    ```typescript
    // src/integrations/supabase/client.ts

    const SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
    const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";
    ```

    *Note: For a production setup, it is highly recommended to use environment variables (`.env` file) for these keys.*

### 4. Set Up Supabase Database

You will need to set up the database tables that the application uses. You can find the schema details within the Supabase types file (`src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`) or run the SQL statements from your Supabase project's SQL Editor to create the `projects`, `blogs`, and `site_sections` tables.

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the local development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üîê Admin Access

-   To access the admin dashboard, navigate to `/admin-login`.
-   The default admin credentials are set within the `AdminLogin.tsx` component. For a production environment, you should implement a more secure authentication check, potentially based on user roles within your Supabase project.
